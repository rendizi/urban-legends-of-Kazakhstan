            <p>In the evening, a physical education teacher from a school was astonished as he watched spectral figures playing basketball in the school gym. They were seeking revenge for being disturbed in their rest and used the gym as their field of retribution.</p>

            <p>In 1996, in the new district of Kazak Aul, not far from the urban-type settlement of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A8%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BA">Shubarkuduk</a>, something happened that still terrifies the residents of this town at night. In that year, an old cemetery was demolished to make way for something new, something no one expected. In its place, a new general education school No. 3 was built, and it seemed like everything should go smoothly .</p>

            </div>
            <p>However, about a month after construction began, on dark autumn evenings, on October 14, 1996, the school's physical education teacher, who had stayed in the building after classes, heard something strange. The sound of basketballs bouncing in the gym pierced the silence as if there was a basketball game going on. He decided to investigate.</p>

            </div>
            
            
            <p>Upon opening the gym doors, he saw basketballs bouncing around the hall as if they had come to life. These were the spirits of people who had been buried in that place in ancient times. This mysterious encounter with the ghosts marked the beginning of strange events.</p>

            </div>
            <p>According to local legend, an alternative explanation for this mystical phenomenon was the presence of a gas that emanated from the bones of the deceased, causing the basketballs to bounce. But even this explanation does not solve the mystery of who and how the basketballs were removed from the inventory.

            <p>Since then, many residents of Shubarkuduk avoid passing by the school during the dark hours, and the place where the cemetery once stood has become a subject of persistent mystical legends and horrifying stories. It's the place where basketballs continue to play an eternal game, reminding the living that the past can always return, even in the most unexpected forms.</p>
