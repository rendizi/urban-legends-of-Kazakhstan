            <p>The name of two 25-story buildings at the intersection of Saryarka and Bogenbay Batyr streets, popularly referred to as “Candles,” seems to be just someone’s failed joke that was taken seriously. And all because these houses were literally built on the site of human bones. In the 19th century there was an Orthodox cemetery here.</p>

            </div>
            <p>According to media reports, in 2009, while laying new asphalt in front of these houses, an excavator even dug four wooden coffins out of the ground. These were the remains of buried people. But the residents of the house will not be surprised by such finds, as well as stories about paranormal phenomena. Some say that suicides are not uncommon in these houses, others talk about strange phenomena: suddenly opening windows and slamming doors, unnatural sounds in apartments and even ghosts in hallways.</p>

            <p>“In 2001, I heard that there was a suicide here: a student at the medical academy jumped from the 10th floor, as a result of which she died,” says Alima, who works in a local department store. They say that she had a fight with her boyfriend and decided to commit suicide. And there was another case of suicide of a 16-year-old boy.</p>

            <p>Our customers constantly tell me about strange things happening in their apartments: a window suddenly opens, a bag falls in the house for no reason, or strange sounds at night. In the store, you also often hear about such things. Employees working at night often complained that inexplicable things happened to items from different departments, for example, soft toys could end up in a completely different place.</p>
            <p>Previously, one religious woman worked here. Her name was Natalya. She constantly assured us that our store was guarded by the spirit of a deceased soldier who was buried under our store in the Orthodox cemetery.</p>
            <p>It is known that in Soviet times, in 1973, this cemetery was relocated to another location - to Tlendieva Street. But not all human remains were reburied then. Confirmation of what we said above is the discovery of four wooden coffins in 2009, which were practically rolled under the road asphalt.</p>
